TEXTURE NAMING INSTRUCTIONS
Name each texture using the format
TYPE_DESCRIPTION[VARIANT]_[SUFFIX]
TYPE is a 3 letter code chosen strictly by the material category of the texture (not usage in-game).
DESCRIPTION is a short uppercase name (3–12 characters, no spaces or hyphens) describing what the texture looks like.
VARIANT is a number like 01, 02, 03 if multiple similar versions exist.
SUFFIX is optional; use _DIFF for the main diffusebase texture only when there exists other map textures available, otherwise do not have a suffix at all, _TRAN for transparency maps, _MASK for masks, _SPEC for specular maps, or _NORM for normal maps.
If there is only one file for that texture, you omit the suffix.
Keep everything ALL CAPS, no spaces, no hyphens, no lowercase.
